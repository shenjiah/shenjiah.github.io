<p>Henry Kissinger Forgets What He said
by James Wang</p>
<p>Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, is a
man known for his craftiness in the nuance of diplomatic
language. But, for some reasons, his grips of the skill
seems beginning to rust, as it showed in his article, China:
Containment Won&rsquo;t Work, published in the Washington Post on
June 13, 2005.</p>
<p>Dr. Kissinger stated in that article that &ldquo;almost all
countries &ndash; and all major ones &ndash; have recognized China&rsquo;s
claim that Taiwan is part of China. So have seven American
presidents of both parties &ndash;none more emphatically than
George W. Bush.&rdquo; He misstated the facts and abandoned the
language he deliberately chose in the Shanghai
Communique and used in other two joint communiques
between the United States and China.</p>
<p>The fact is that,in the Shanghai Coomuniques, the United
States &ldquo;acknowledges&rdquo; that all Chinese on either side of the
Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that
Taiwan is part of China. The United States does not
challenge that position. And, in the joint communique
announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations, the
Government of the United States also &ldquo;acknowledges&rdquo; the
Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is
part of China.</p>
<p>Having found that the Chinese text translated &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo;
as &ldquo;cheng-ren,&rdquo; the American side emphasized that to
acknowledge is different from to recognize (Cheng-ren) and
the Unted States holds the English text as official one. Now
Dr. Kissinger forgot what the U.S. insisted, accepted the
language used by the Chinese and made a false statement that
the U.S. &ldquo;recognizes&rdquo; Chinese claim over Taiwan.</p>
<p>In dealing with Chinese claims, countries like Japan used
different language to avoid recognizing Chinese position.
Some countries just &ldquo;take note of &quot; Chinese position and
Japan expressed its &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; of Chinese position. To
say that all major countries &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; Chinese position on
this issue is a unforgivable factual error.</p>
<p>Dr. Kissinger mentioned that the improvement of relations
between the U.S. and China has been based on three
principles, one of them was &ldquo;American recognition of the one
China principle and opposition to an independent Taiwan.&rdquo; He
should know better or he should double-check with his
memorandum of conversations with Chinese leaders. The U. S.
has its &ldquo;One China policy&rdquo; which is different from so-called
&ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; asserted by the Chinese.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the high level contacts between
the U.S. and China in 1971, American officials,
including Henry Kissinger and President Richard M. Nixon,
have assured Chinese leaders that the U.S. government &ldquo;does
not support Taiwan independent movement.&rdquo; When President
Bill Clinton stated his &ldquo;three nos&rdquo; in Shanghai in 1998, he
changed the language to the U.S. &ldquo;does not support Taiwan
independent.&rdquo; He was dishonest, when responded to
congressional inquiries, in saying that his assurances had
been there since Nixon&rsquo;s visit to China in 1972.</p>
<p>Just as their twisting of the words &ldquo;to acknowledge&rdquo; into
&ldquo;to recognize,&rdquo; the Chinese translate &ldquo;does not support&rdquo;
as &ldquo;to oppose&rdquo; in Chinese. Once again Dr. Kissinger forgets
the language he crafted at the very beginning and
mistakingly uses the stronger language preferred by the
Chinese translation.</p>
<p>As usual, Dr. Kissinger showed strong sympathy for China
and accepted China&rsquo;s defense against outside criticism. He
arugued that Chinese military budget is less than 20 percent
of America&rsquo;s and mush less than the combined military
budgets of Japan, India and Russia, not to speak of Taiwan&rsquo;s
military modernization support by American decision made in
2001. He preferred to ignore the fact that none of those
countries posed any threat to China. It is China that has
been building up its military and boasting that their
major goal was to deter the U.S. from defending Taiwan
agianst China&rsquo;s ivasion that cause alarm. in the region.
Dr. Kissinger just ignore the fact that China is
challenging America&rsquo;s long standing position that the issue
of Taiwan Strait should be settled by peaceful means.</p>
<p>I do not have answer to the question why Dr. Kissinger
shifted his use of sensitive languages and adopted Chinese
positions. I am puzzled. But to his credits, he honestly
admits in his Washington Post article that China is a client
of his consulting firm and he spent a week in China in
May &ldquo;much of it as a guest of the government.&rdquo; That may
help us understand his views better.</p>
