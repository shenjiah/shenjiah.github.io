			<p>Calling a spade a spade               James C. Wang</p>
<p>Referring to Taiwan as &ldquo;The Republic of Taiwan,&rdquo; President
George W. Bush of the United States caused an uproar in
China and a ripple in Taiwan.</p>
<p>As can be expected, Beijing asked for clarification and
government-controlled media expressed their dismay and
indignation. That is routine business. No matter whether the
remark is intentional or a slip of tongue, Beijing has no
choice but to protest and put their position on the record.</p>
<p>As a matter of necessity, China loads protests to
the United States whenever it perceives any American action
as violation of its so-called &ldquo;One China&quot;principle. China
wants to build up its case that Taiwan is &ldquo;part of China.&rdquo;
Even though Taiwan has been a separate country for more than
half a century, China will do whatever it can to weaken
Taiwan&rsquo;s separate identity and make its claim of sovereignty
over Taiwan more credible.</p>
<p>China would not admit it, but it is obvious that it has no
legal base to claim sovereignty over Taiwan except insisting
that Taiwan and international community accept its &ldquo;One
China&rdquo; principle. Taiwan as a democracy can not and should
not fall into this trap. Neither should the United Satets.</p>
<p>In contrast to the one-voice negative reaction in China, the
reactions in the democratic Taiwan were as usual more
divided. The pro-independence or pro-status quo forever
majority deeply appreciated to hear President Bush
called a spade a spade. The small but vocal pro-unification
mainlanders shared their outrage with the Chinese on the
mainland against President Bush and presumed that President
Bush misspoke.</p>
<p>I can understand China&rsquo;s reaction because it is in their
interests. But I am puzzled by the reaction of the tiny
pro-unification group in Taiwan who were part of the staunch
anti-commuinists ruling authorities in the martial law era.
Now they prefer to live in Taiwan but want to see Taiwan
under China&rsquo;s control!</p>
<p>To be sure, the constitutional name of Taiwan is not the
Republic of Taiwan. But Taiwan is a well-known common name
of the area across the Taiwan Straits independent from China
and politically Taiwan is a Republic. What else you can find
a name better fit to identify Taiwan in international
community than the Republic of Taiwan?</p>
<p>After more than half a century of political evolution,
Republic of China has been &ldquo;Taiwanized,&rdquo; no longer claiming
or being recognized as government of China. The battle over
China representation was over in 1971 when the Republic of
China was soundly defeated and expelled from the United
Nations. To continue to claim that ROC represents China
should be considered as &ldquo;provocative&rdquo; to China and crazy.
The only way for Taiwan to survive as an independent state
is to build up its separate identity through democratic
process.</p>
<p>When the mainlander-dominated KMT was in power, the
authorities refused to adapt a new separate identity because
it could cost them the legal base, however false it was, to
rule Taiwan. Legally speaking the sovereignty of Taiwan
should belong to either the people of Taiwan or China. No
wonder Chiang Kai-shek would rather have jade broken than an
earthern tile intact.</p>
<p>Chiang&rsquo;s hardlines were not necessarily shared by all the
ruling mainlanders. According to recently declassified
diplomatic files, U.S. Ambassador Watlter McConaughy
reported to Washington after the U.N. expulsion in 1971 that
H. K. Yang, then vice foreign minister, had told him that
for Taiwan to survive it is necessary to declare that &ldquo;the
government of Taiwan is entirely separate and apart from the
government on the mainland and that henceforth the
government here will have nothing to do with the mainland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H. K. Yang said, according to Amb. McConaughy, the
declaration should prescribe a new designation for the
government, namely &ldquo;The Chinese Republis of Taiwan.&rdquo; It
would be stipulated that the term Chinese did not have any
political connotation but was used merely as a generic term
stemming from the Chinese ethnic origin of the population in
Taiwan. It would be used in a way similar to the manner in
which the various Arab countries use &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; in their
official government titles.</p>
<p>Of course, it is now history. But it showed that H. K. Yang
understood that technically the legal status of Taiwan
remained to be determined. For ROC to have legal case to
rule Taiwan as a sovereign state, it has to give up its
claims of representing all China, which had been a lost
cause, and become government of Taiwan.</p>
<p>In that sense, President Bush almost cited the same name for
Taiwan as suggested by H. K. Yang some 30 years ago. They
all pointed to the fact that Taiwan is a separate state.
Through demoractic process, which is consistent with the</p>
<p>U.N. charter and international covenants on human rights,
the people of Taiwan have made it clear that Taiwan is a
sovereign state. Constitutionally it is still The Republic
of China, but it is &ldquo;entirely separate and apart&rdquo; from the
government on mainland and has nothing to do with
mainland.</p>
<p>Eventually Taiwan may be able to call a spade a spade and
every one would be proud to be citizen of the Republic of
Taiwan, which would co-exist peacefully with all its
neighbors, including the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.</p>
