<p>The victor and the defeated: 60 years later
by James Wang</p>
<p>On the eve of the end of the Second World War, one recently
released report come to my mind. It is unrelated to
the war, but it reminds us how much has changed in East Asia
since the end of the war.</p>
<p>In a report to the Congress on the military power of
the PRC, the Petagon states that China&rsquo;s modernization
of its military, over the long run, could pose a
credible threat to other modern militaries operating in the
region.</p>
<p>If we read the report together with the outrageous statement
made by PLA Gen. Chu Chengwu that PRC should use nuclear
weapons against the U.S. in case the U.S. intervenes to
defend Taiwan, we can see clearly who the demon is.</p>
<p>The Pentagon report states the obvious trend foreseen almost
60 years ago by the great warrior of the Pacific region,
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and, in a sense, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Gen. MacArthur and Gimo Chiang shared strong anit-communism
ideology and strategy to defeat the communist China before
it rises to threat the free world. But their similarity
stopped there. In terms of statemanship and dedication to
democracy and freedom, Gimo Chiang is not MacArthur.</p>
<p>Both Gen. MacArthur and Gimo Chiang played an important role
in the post war era. Gen. MacArthur occupied and
administered the defeated Japan while Gimo Chiang occupied
and administered Formosa and Pescadores, which were parts of
territories of the defeated Japan, pending the conclusion of
peace treaty.</p>
<p>Gen. MacArthur arrived in Tokyo as Japanese lined up the
streets with their backs toward him as a sign of defiance.
They expected humiliation, starvations and deprivations as a
result of defeat and occupations by the victor and conqueor.</p>
<p>But Gen. MacArthur administered Japan as a democratic
reformer, who directed the adoption of a new, mordern,
democratic constitution which transfers sovereignty from the
Emperor to the Japanese people and makes Japan give up war
as a means in solving international disputes.</p>
<p>He gave Japanese women voting rights  and the farmers the
land they deserve.</p>
<p>He brought liberal education to Japan to substitute for its
ultranationalistic and militaristic indoctrinations.</p>
<p>And he began rebuilding Japan from the ruins and showed her
way to economic prosperity.</p>
<p>When he was dismissed by President Harry Truman over policy
disputes, Japanese bursted into tears in bidding him
goodbye.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Yoshida&rsquo;s broadcast for the nation said it
well, &ldquo;The accomplishments of Gen. MacArthur in the interest
of our country are one of the marvels of history. It is he
who has salvaged our nation from post-surrender confusion
and prostration, and steered the country on the road of
recovery and recontruction. It is he who has firmly planted
democracy in all sements of our society&hellip;I have no words to
convey the regret of our nation to see him leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gimo Chiang and his general&rsquo;s occupation of
Taiwan was a different story. Gimo Chiang&rsquo;s troops arrived
in Formosa as &ldquo;liberator,&rdquo; and welcome as &ldquo;compatriots&rdquo;
at the early statage.</p>
<p>But the KMT occupying forces behaved as victor and
conqueror. They were not eager to rebuild Taiwan or make
necessary reforms but take the advantage of confusion to
benefit themselves.</p>
<p>Taiwanese exepcted to enjoy better treatment by the
occupation administration of &ldquo;mother land,&rdquo; but what they
got were incompetence, mismanagement and corruption of the
Chinese officials. Taiwanese were denied participations in
the government and excluded from significant areas of trade
and commerce.</p>
<p>The occupation forces had no idea what is democracy and
what is reform. What they understood was to get rich by
corruptions. The worsening of living conditions led to
island-wide uprising on Feb. 28, 1947, within merely 16
months of occupation. A generation of elite Taiwanese were
wiped out in the massive purges and murders.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government of KMT annexed Taiwan as a
province of China even before peace treaty with Japan was
negotiated. It took measures to tranform Taiwnese into
&ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; and carried out Chinese nationalism, and later
anticommunism, propaganda in place of Japnaese
indoctrination in nationalism and militarism.</p>
<p>The KMT government, which was defeated by the Chinese
communists, exiled to Taiwan and imposed on Taiwan a
constitution that had never been implemented in China and
had nothing to do with Taiwan.</p>
<p>The U.S. concluded its occupation of Japan in seven years,
the KMT government continued to occupied Taiwan until year
2000 when they were voted out by the people of Taiwan in the
democratic process which had been finally established in
1996.</p>
<p>Japan took a short cut while Taiwan took a torturous
route, but both have become peace-loving democracies.</p>
<p>The irony is that China emerged as a &ldquo;victor&rdquo; after
sufferring long conflicts with Japan. The communists
replaced the nationalists as the rulers of China and
combined communism with nationalism in totalitarian system.</p>
<p>China was the country that fought against the United Nations
and the U.S. forces in the Korea war. It was the one
fighting the U.S. with proxy in Viet Nam.</p>
<p>With the disintegraion of Soviet Union, China became the
only victory country that threaten peace and stability. It
challenges the status quo that has existed for 60 years.</p>
<p>China is rising, but without political reform and democracy,
it could only rise as a demon and a threat. China is showing
it in words and deeds.</p>
