<p>Peng Ming-min Case as seen in American Diplomatic Files
by James Wang</p>
<p>Forty years ago, Gimo Chiang Kai-shek was still
enthusiastically shouting slogans of counter-attack and
regaining control over Chinese mainland. But outsiders knew
better. The situations, domestic and international, were
getting worse. His dream of returning to Chinese mainland as
liberator was rapidly fading away.</p>
<p>Early in 1964, Gen. de Gaulle decided to abandon Gimo Chiang
and recognize Mao&rsquo;s regime as representative of China.</p>
<p>Even Kim Shin, South Korea&rsquo;s Ambassador to ROC and a close
freind of Gimo Chiang, confided to Ralph Clough, DCM of the
U.S. Embassy in Taipei, that although he wished ROC could
recover the Chinese Mainland, he felt that the goal had gone
beyond ROC&rsquo;s reach. The international status of the ROC
would continue to deteriorate and it would be unable to
claim that it represented whole China. There would be
serious domestic repercussions.</p>
<p>Unknown to Gimo Chiang, he would have serious problems in
his hands sooner than expected. The regime of the PRC was
secretly developing nuclear weapons and would sucessfully
tested it in October.That would effectively shatter his
dream of recovering Chinese Mainland. And a young rising
star in Taiwan&rsquo;s academic community, Professor Peng
Ming-min, together with his two former students, were
secretly preparing a declaration which would indict Gimo
Chiang&rsquo;s fictious China and point to the way that the people
of Taiwan should do to maintain Taiwan as a new democratic
country.</p>
<p>The document prepared by Dr. Peng and his students,
Declaration On Taiwan Self-Salvation Movement, never got the
chance to see the daylight. Thousands of copies of the
document were confiscated as soon as the press stopped and
Dr. Peng and his students were arrested on charges of
sedition.</p>
<p>The secret arrests were  not made public
until October 24, 1964. No report on Dr. Peng&rsquo;s arrest from
U.S. Embassy in Taipei  was found until January 29, 1965
when the Embassy told Washington that Dr. Peng would be put
on trial in a few weeks and that there had been rumors
that Dr. Peng claimed to have the encouragement of Americans
in his activities.</p>
<p>According to the Embassy report, the sources of the rumors
were from the ruling KMT. The editor of the Tzu Li Wan Pao,
Mr. Li Tse-yi, told American Embassy employee that Ralph
Clough would be transferred soon because Dr. Peng had
involed the DCM in his confession. Mr. Li cited Ho
Hao-jo, a professor at the National Defense College, as his
source of information, saying Ho had been sent to persuade
Dr. Peng to cooperate and repent.</p>
<p>On February 6, 1965, the Embassy reported to
Washington the indictment of Peng Ming-min. It is
interesting to note that that English translation copy of
the indictment was given to Americans by Defense Minister
Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Gimo Chiang.
Minister Chiang even passed a message that Dr. Peng had
stated to interrogators that he had been strongly influenced
by a number of Americans. However, Chiang emphasized that in
order not to arouse anti-American feelings these allegations
had been left out of the indictment.</p>
<p>The Embassy comment on the indictment in its report that
although Dr. Peng was charged &ldquo;to use illegal methods to
change the constitution and to overthrow the government,&rdquo;
the evidence given in the indictment appeared only to prove
that Dr. Peng and his colleagues conspired to prepare and
print a pamphlet advocating self-salvation of Taiwan.</p>
<p>On April 2, 1965 a military court found Dr. Peng and his two
former students guilty of conspiring through the printing of
a pamphlet &ldquo;to overthrow the government.&rdquo; In its report to
the State Department the Embassy in Taipei pointed out that
the document apparently &ldquo;insulted the competence&rdquo; of Gimo
Chiang and others by saying that the counterattack against
Chinese Mainland was impossible. But no solid evidence had
been produced which proved the charge that the defendants
had attempted to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>However, the Embassy emphasized that no mention was made of
Taiwan independence and the iclusion of a call for the
solidarity of Taiwanese and mainlanders at least indicated
an attempt to avoid a clear cut case of treason.</p>
<p>The Embaasy seemed relieved to report to Washington that
during the trial no mention was made in the testimony of any
connection with the case of Japanese, Americans, or
Communist elements.</p>
<p>Largely as a result of a campaign on his behalf in the
American academic community,Dr. Peng was released after six
months imprisonment, according to Amb. Walter McConaughy&rsquo;s
report to the State Department.</p>
<p>On December 4, 1965, the Embassy received from local
American newsman three articles prepared by Dr. Peng.
The most interesting of the three article was the untitled
one that raised twelve questions that Dr. Peng said he
intended to shock the KMT authorities and cmplacent
Taiwanese intelletuals into debate on the future of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Among the questions that Dr. Peng raised are What is the
&ldquo;government of China&rdquo; which has lost China forever? Whom
does it represent? How long is one going to continue to
accept the fiction of Nationalist Government as &ldquo;Government
of China&rdquo; and the myth of &ldquo;recovery of mainland China&rdquo; by
this government?</p>
<p>Of course Dr. Peng failed to provoke a great debate on
Formosa&rsquo;s future because the questions he raised had never
had the chance to be heard.</p>
<p>Dr. Peng wished he could return to teach at National Taiwan
University, but that was out of the question. He looked for
teaching job overseas but MKT wouldn&rsquo;t let him leave Taiwan.
Amb. McConaughy reported that even if the United States
Governemnt made strong representations on his behalf, it is
unlikely that the GRC would permit Peng to accept an ACLS
grant and leave Taiwan.</p>
<p>As soon as Dr. Henry A. Kissinger became President Richard
Nixon&rsquo;s national security adviser in 1969, Dr. Peng wrote a
letter to him asking for advice. Dr. Peng was a paticipant
in Harvard International Seminar in Tokyo hosted by Dr.
Kissinger, a Harvard University professor.</p>
<p>The letter was forwarded by  Yoichi Yokobori,
a Japanese scholar attneded the same seminar, to the White
House with a lengthy letter detailing Dr. Peng&rsquo;s situation.
A NSC staff sent Mr. Yokobori a form letter thanking him
for &ldquo;calling our attention to Professor Peng&rsquo;s problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things seemed calmed down a little, but all in a sudden, on
January 23, 1970, two resident American journalists called
at the Embassy to check a report that Dr. Peng had escaped
from Taiwan. The Embassy also denied a rumor that Dr. Peng
was smuggled out through Ching Chuan Kang Airbase, which
was heavily used by the USAF.</p>
<p>Despite all kind of rumors, the first solid information
about Dr. Peng&rsquo;s route of escape emerged on February 29,
1970 from American Consul in Hong Kong which quoted a
Swedish businessman Congen Kuellberg as saying that Dr. Peng
had travelled to Sweden via SAS under an alias.</p>
<p>American scholar Loren Fessler told State Department
officials that he was convinced Dr. Peng had transited Japan
on his way to Stockholm, but Dr. Peng denied that and
jokingly said he had &ldquo;rowed to Hong Kong from Kaohsiung with
my one good arms&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A FBI confidential report seemed to confirmed that Dr. Peng
had used fake identity to escape from Taiwan to Hong Kong on
his way to Sweden. According to the report, U.S. Customs
officials at the Metro Airport, Detroit, intercepted a
suitcase addressed to Dr. Peng at the University of Michigan
from Stockholm and examined it. They found a male wig and a
Japanese passport in the name of Abe Kenicki with a date of
birth shown as October 25, 1937. The Japanese passport
number D-310319 was issued November 22, 1969 in Tokyo.</p>
<p>As soon as Dr. Peng&rsquo;s escape was confirmed, the
KMT regime furiously devoted its diplomatic efforts to
prevent Dr. Peng from entering into the United States.
Ambassador Chow Shu-kai presented a memorandum on
January 29, 1970 to assistant secretary of state Marshall
Green requesting American government to reject any
application by Dr. Peng to &ldquo;seek entry into the U.S. or
asylum therein&rdquo; in view of USG-GRC friendly relations and
&ldquo;to anticipate any attempt on Peng&rsquo;s part to carry on his
treacherous activities in the U.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amb. Chow emphasized that in light of recent developments,
admission of Peng to the U.S. would give rise to
misinterpretation that his departure from Taiwan and
probable activities are condoned by the U.S. and even USG
had connived in his escape.</p>
<p>Ambassador Green cautioned that GRC and the USG should
consider seriously whether refusal to permit Peng enter the
U.S. would be in GRC&rsquo;s interest, in view of the likelihood
that the case would become cause celebre and Peng probably
become focal point for generating press stories and
criticism harmful to GRC&rsquo;s interests and relations between
two sides.</p>
<p>He suggested an alternative to handle the case in a manner
that would minimize publicity by permitting Peng to enter by
doing what the U.S. can to persuade him to avoid statement
and actions against government friendly to the U.S.</p>
<p>On February 26, 1970, The American Embassy in Taipei filed a
lengthy report to the State Department arguing against
granting visa to Dr. Peng. The Embassy said that it believed
that the admission of Peng to the U.S. would &ldquo;create
considerable strain in US-GRC relations and increase GRC
suspicions of U.S. China policy.</p>
<p>Dr. Peng visited American Embassy in Stockholm on March 16,
190 and applied for tourist visa to the U.S. It was
coincided with the upcoming visit of Chiang Ching-kuo to the
U.S. in April. And Dr. Peng&rsquo;s application was withheld.</p>
<p>Ambassador McConaughy returned to Washington for
consultation in July, 1970 and urged the State
Department at least delay granting visa to Peng until the
fall of 1971.</p>
<p>The KMT government continued to put pressure on the USG.
Foreign Minister Wei Tao-min summoned Ambassador McConaughy
on August 28, 1970, to reiterated GRC&rsquo;s concern over
possibility that the U.S. would admit Peng. Wei said the
matter was a &ldquo;vital matter&rdquo; to the GRC. And that admitting
Peng to the U.S. would be considered as &ldquo;unfriendly act&rdquo; by
the GRC.</p>
<p>However, on September 3, 1970, under secretary of State U.
Alexis Johnson approved issuing Dr. Peng a non-immigrant
visa. In his letter to Dr. Kissinger, Amb. Johnson said that
although the GRC would not like this, &ldquo;we have to bite the
bullet sometime and I think it better to do so before the
matter is built up into cause celebre. Albeit reluctantly,
Walter McConaughy agrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assistant secretary of state Green informed Ambassador Chow
of the U.S. decision on September 16 that Dr. Peng was not
ineligible to receive nonimmigrant visa and that he would
be issued such a visa on September 17.</p>
<p>Mr. Green told Amb. Chow that the decision was
considered the best way to handle the problem in terms of
both legal and political factors and in terms of mutual
intersets.</p>
<p>Amb. Chow responded that he was &ldquo;distressed&rdquo; to learn of the
U.S. decision which would cause &ldquo;great alarm&rdquo; in Taipei. He
said that his government would rather face storm
from American Congress and academic community than
&ldquo;infinite trouble&rdquo; which Peng&rsquo;s presence in the
U.S. would cause here and elswhere. He hoped
that USG would review the decision.</p>
<p>On September 18, Acting foreign minister James Shen
expressed his &ldquo;shock&rdquo; about the decision in his conversation
with DCM of the American Embassy. He called the USG decision
on such a sensitive issue of &ldquo;great importance&rdquo; as
&ldquo;deplorable&rdquo; and he could not considered it as freindly act.</p>
<p>Four days later Amb. Chow was instructed to express GRC&rsquo;s
&ldquo;great dismay&rdquo; at Washington&rsquo;s decision to grant Peng a visa
because GRC believed that Peng&rsquo;s arrival could do &ldquo;serious
damage&rdquo; to GRC. He renew request that the USG reconsider the
decision to admit Peng &ldquo;in order to avoid undue
misunderstanding and avert any other undesirable
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amb. Green assured Amb. Chow that the USG had put Peng on
notice that he being admitted only on understanding that he
not engage in organized political activities. But Amb. Chow
argued that Peng was certain to engage in political
activities and that no effective was of insuring he would
not do so.</p>
<p>The United States did not reconsidered GRC&rsquo;s appeal and Dr.
Peng arrived in the U.S. in late September 1970 to be a
visiiting scholar at University of Michigan. The GRC Embassy
in Washington used moles to spy on him and tried to kick him
out of the U.S. but to no avail.</p>
<p>Amb. Chow and KMT government proved to be right: there
was no way to keep Dr. Peng out of political activities. He
became leader and spirit leader of Taiwan independence
movement that indeed gave KMT regime &ldquo;indefinite
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dr. Peng proved to be visionary: what he advocated in
the declaration forty years ago have been achieved or
accepted as goal of the people of Taiwan. The declaration is
the most important document of Taiwan&rsquo;s democratization.</p>
