<p>San Francisco Peace Treaty Revisited      by James Wang</p>
<p>When former president Lee Teng-hui embraced the idea that
&ldquo;sovereignty resides in the people,&rdquo; his statement didn&rsquo;t
raise many eyebrows. Almost everyone took it for
granted because it is the ABC&rsquo;s of Democarcy and it was
stipulated in Article 2 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>And, when George W. Bush, President of the United States,
insisted that the resolution of the disputes between Taiwan
and the People&rsquo;s Republic of Chinashould have the consent of
the people of Taiwan, he seemed also talking along the line
of Democracy.</p>
<p>But, putting together, these statements were milestones in
the evolution of Taiwan&rsquo;s legal status.</p>
<p>Students of U.S. policies toward China and Taiwan are well
aware of late president Harry Truman&rsquo;s statement in 1950
announcing that the status of Taiwan remained to be
determined. But they didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the fact
that, technically, the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan
failed to settle the sovereignty issue of Taiwan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No provision has been made either in the San Francisco
Treaty or the Sino-Japanese Treaty as to the future of
Taiwan and Penghu,&rdquo; late foreign minister George Yeh
explained to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, we are controlling them now, and undoubtly they
constitute a part of our territories. However, the delicate
international situation make it that they do not belong to
us. Under the circumstances, Japan has no right to transfer
Formosa and the Pescadores to us. Nor can we accept such a
transfer from Japan even if she so wishes,&rdquo; Goerge Yeh
added.</p>
<p>This was one of the statements cited by U. S. State
Department legal experts to support their position that from
legal point of views the sovereignty of Taiwan remained
undetermined.</p>
<p>In the declassified State Department files, I found two
memoranda with regard to the legal status of Taiwan, one was
done in 1961 by Mr. John Czyzak, legal adiviser of the Far
East Affairs Bureau; another was a rewritting of Mr.
Czyzak&rsquo;s study in non-technical language by Robert Starr in
1971.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Czyzak&rsquo;s study, four legal theories have
been advanced concerning the status of Taiwan and the
Pescadores:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sovereignty over the islands has not been finally
determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The islands belong to the Republic of China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The islands belong to China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The islands now form a condominium belong either to the
victorious powers of the Second World War or to the
parties to the Japanese Peace Treaty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After a lengthy anaysis, Mr. Czyzak concluded that &ldquo;the most
tenable theory regarding the status of Formosa and the
Pescadores is that sovereignty over the islands has not been
finally determined.&rdquo; The conclusion was restated in Mr.
Starr&rsquo;s memorandum in 1971 and accepted as legal and
political positions of the United States.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Charles Bray, spokeman of the State
Department, repeated this position on April 28, 1971.
And in preparartions for the normalization of relations with
PRC, Mr. John Stevenson, legal adviser of the State
Department, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Marshall Green,
Assistant Secretary of State, on Nov. 12, 1971 that &ldquo;since
the 1952 Japanese Peace Treaty, the United States has taken
the position that status of Taiwan is undetermined, subject
to some future international resolution. That position has
been stated publicly from time to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Mr. Stevenson, such position has formed an
important legal basis for multual defense treaty with Taiwan
and &ldquo;a potential legal basis for Taiwan Independence if that
should ever become a realitic possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Steveson didn&rsquo;t realize that Dr. Henry A.
Kissinger, National Security Adviser to President Richard M.
Nixon, had already assured Chinese premier Chou En-lai
during his secret visit to Beijing that the U. S. government
would not repeat Mr. Bray&rsquo;s statement again.</p>
<p>Mr. Nixon made the same promise in conversations with Chou
in 1972:&quot; There will be no more statement made, if I can
control our bureaucracy, to the effect that the status of
Taiwan is undetermined.&quot;</p>
<p>Even Mr. Nixon and his successors have successfully silenced
the bureaucracy on this issue, they can not deny the
validity of Mr. Czyzak&rsquo;s legal analysis.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Czyzak, sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu in
later date might belong to a) part of a single state of
China; b)part of the state of the Republic of China as it
has been left as a result of the Chinese civil war; c) a new
state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision can be made through agreement by victorious
countries of World War II or by agreement by parties to
Peace Treaty, through a plebicite or through international
recognition of the continued occupation by an authority
claiming full sovereignty,&rdquo; Mr. Czyzak wrote.</p>
<p>That is why Mr. Lee&rsquo;s statement of &ldquo;sovereignty residing in
the people&rdquo; was a milestone in the evolution of Taiwan&rsquo;s
legal status. Since Republic of China has been &ldquo;Taiwanized&rdquo;
through democratic processes, even if it is not a new state,
it is a separate state from the PRC and its claims of
sovereignty over Taiwan is the most tenable.</p>
<p>In that sense it is especially heartened to hear President
Goerge W. Bush solemnly stating that the resolution of
disputes between Taiwan and the PRC should have the consent
of the people in Taiwan. This is the closest thing he can
say short of recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush is in sync with Mr. Lee&rsquo;s advocate that sovereignty
resides in the people.</p>
