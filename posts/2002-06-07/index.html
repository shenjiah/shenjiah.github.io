<p>The Triangular Relations Become History      By James Wang</p>
<p>Without a fanafre,the United States and Russia reached a
three-page long nuclear arms reduction treaty, and Russia
becomes a partner of NATO, indicating its further
integration with the West.</p>
<p>After a bitter collapse in the early 1990&rsquo;s, Russia finally
finds its peace with itself and its former enemies.</p>
<p>Now we can see a Russia that cooperates with the United
States and other major powers to promote peace and stability
around the world. We can see a Russia that walks away from
confrontations and arms races and rushes toward economic
development.</p>
<p>Moscow understands that the future of Russia relied on
accesses to the markets in the West and investments from
overseas. The proud and nationalistic Russians are now
satisfied to play a less significant role in international
affairs.</p>
<p>The Russians reoriented their policies toward privatization
and free market. The United States has not yet
called it free market economy. But, given time, the Russians
are getting there under a democratic system.</p>
<p>This is a historic evolution of Russia from the archenemy,
politically, militarily, economically and ideologically, of
the West for over half a century to a democratic partner.</p>
<p>The United States has achieved one of its long standing
policy gpals: to make Europe whole and free.</p>
<p>Such developments would put a lot of pressure on the People
Republic of China. When the fromer Soviet Union collapsed
Chinese elder leader Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying that
it was worthy to kill twenty thousands innocent people to
make sure the survival of the communist regime.</p>
<p>Obviously the Chinese took a different approache to handle
its domestic and foreign policy issues than the
Russians. Beijing opened up its economy without carrying out
any meaningful political reform. China&rsquo;s developments were
so imbalanced that the gap between the poors and the riches
becomes one of the worst case in the world.</p>
<p>The communist or socialist government was supposed to take
better care of the welfare of the workers and farmers, the
disadvantaged class of China, but in the name of better job
and better living standard, the workers&rsquo; rights were
sacrificed and farmers were left in poverty.</p>
<p>Even insisting that it needs a stable international
environment for its economic development, China, unlike
Russia, has not found peace with its own people or its
neighbors.</p>
<p>China continues to build up military in the name of military
modernization and bully Japan whenever Tokyo behaves to the
dislike of Beijing.</p>
<p>China vowed to swallow up Taiwan either by forces or by
&ldquo;peaceful means&rdquo; and charged that the United States is
the block to Beijing&rsquo;s goal. China seems blind to Taiwan&rsquo;s
democracy or reluctant to face reality.</p>
<p>Of course, the Chinese exploited their past humiliations and
nationalism for good reason. But a regime that depends on
nationalism for its survival is at a great risk. It could be
pushed over the brink and faced a situation it may prefer to
avoid.</p>
<p>When Richard Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger seized the split
of China and former Soviet Union to play so-called &ldquo;China
card&rdquo; to serve the interests of the United States, China&rsquo;s
Mao and Zhou willingly played &ldquo;America card&rdquo; to fend off
Soviets Union&rsquo;s aggressive behavior and played &ldquo;Russia card&rdquo;
to improve relations with the United States at the expenses
of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;Triangular Relations&rdquo; lead to normalization
of relations between the United States and China and detente
between the United States and Soviet Union. It was credited
with the ending of the Vietnam conflicts. The major victim
of the big powers manipulation was Taiwan, which was under
Chiang&rsquo;s authoritarian rule and claimed to represent whole
China, including Mongolia.</p>
<p>China benefitted so much from playing &ldquo;Russia card&rdquo; that it
tend to forget the &ldquo;Russia card&rdquo; no longer exist.</p>
<p>Russia is so accommodating to the needs of the United States
that it raised no objection to American use of military
bases in former Soviet Republics. Moscow became a partner of
NATO in the NATO-Russia Council and would let NATO expand to
include former Soviet Republics.</p>
<p>The American special forces are training troops in the
former Soviet Republic of Georgia, an event that was
unthinkable a few years ago.</p>
<p>With the disappearence of the &ldquo;Russia card,&rdquo; it is time for
China to adjust and reorient its domestic and foreign
policies. The government  should reconcil with its own
people, begin long-over-due political reforms and respect
human rights.</p>
<p>It should respect Taiwan&rsquo;s right to exist as a democratic
and sovereign state if the people of Taiwan so desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is economy, stupid,&rdquo; said the slogan of former president
Bill Clinton&rsquo;s campaign. China&rsquo;s future depends on its
economic development and necessary political reforms, not
acquisition of additional territories or bullying its
neighbors.</p>
<p>Its persistent military build up and threat to use forces
against Taiwan could only ruin whatever it has achieved in
economic front and lead China into another disaster.</p>
