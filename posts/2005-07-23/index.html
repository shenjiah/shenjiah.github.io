<p>U.S. Should Help Taiwan On the Diplomatic Front</p>
<pre><code>                               by James Wang
</code></pre>
<p>Although the U.S. government continues to complain about
the lack of transparency in China&rsquo;s military modernizaton,
it is crystal clear that China&rsquo;s militray build-up
poses a seriuos threat to the security of Taiwan and,
in the long terms, the U.S. forces in the area.</p>
<p>China has arrogantly repeated its threats and
intimidations through words and deeeds. And the annual
report to the U.S. Congress by the Pentagon could not
but draw that alarming conclusion.</p>
<p>To help Taiwan maintain its credible deterrence against
China&rsquo;s use of forces and prevent Taiwan from being
involuntarily annexed, the U.S. has approved sale of a
package of advanced defensise weapons to Taiwan. This is an
important countermeasure for the U.S. and Taiwan to take
and it is consistent with the deterrence strategy adopted by
both countries to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</p>
<p>But it is not enough to strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s military front
for the deterrence strategy to work. As the Pentagon report
points out, the cross-Starit military balance appears to be
&ldquo;shifting toward Beijing as a result of China&rsquo;s sustained
economic growth, growing diplomatic leverage, and
improvments in the PLA&rsquo;s military capabilities.&rdquo; Therefore,
it is obvious that merely beefing up defense forces is
inadquate to address the increasing imbalace of power
between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>To maintain the status quo and insure peaceful resolution of
disputes between the two sides, the U.S. should also help
Taiwan on the diplomatic front.</p>
<p>When the U.S. normalized its relations with China in 1979,
American officials argued that the U.S. should continue to
sell defensive weapons to Taiwan and make Taiwan feel
secure and confident to begin dialogue with China. But the
ruling authoritarian regime of KMT, claiming as representing
all China, refused even to &ldquo;contact&rdquo; with PRC.</p>
<p>The irony is that the U.S. critized KMT regime&rsquo;s
suppression of human rights and pushed for democratization
in Taiwan, but when Taiwan achieved its democratization,
elected a truely representative government, and gave up
its claims of sovereignty over China, the U.S. continued to
ignore the fact that Taiwan and China are &ldquo;mutually
unsubordinated&rdquo; separate states. The U.S. wants to maintain
&ldquo;status quo&rdquo; in the Taiwan Strait area but refuses to
recognize a democratic government&rsquo;s position that the status
quo of Taiwan is a sovereign country with official name as
Republic of China.</p>
<p>The democratization of Taiwan did not win recognization
from the U.S. and other countries. On the contrary, it
opened up the political process for China to exploit under
its united front stategy. By refusing to conduct dialogue
with Taiwan government on equal footing on the one hand, and
welcoming KMT and other politicians who earnestly curry
favour with their old nenemy under its terms on the other,
China tries to damage domestic sovereignty of DPP
government.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s strategy was to threat Taiwan with military forces
and isolate Taiwan with diplomatic leverage, with the goal
to annex Taiwan and change the status quo of regional
balnace of power in its favour.</p>
<p>For Taiwan to deal with such difficult situation and
maintain its status as a democratic sovereign country, it
needs not only military deterrence forces but also
diplomatic recognitions. The U.S. and the international
community can not and should not deprive Taiwan of its
diplomatic status to fight against an involuntary
&ldquo;unification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As international lawyers would argue that there is nothing
standing in the way for two sovereign states to merge
peacefully as one if they wish, there is no reason for the
U.S. government and international community to deny
diplomatic recognitions to Taiwan that it deserves.</p>
<p>With international recognition, Taiwan would feel more
secure and confident to deal with China.
It may also eliminate the pressure on the Taiwan
government to change its official name or revise the
constitution in order to win international recognition.</p>
<p>With its economic growth and military modernization, China&rsquo;s
influence in the Asia-Pacific area is increasing. The U.S.
is right to welcome a peacful and prosperous China as a
responsible member of international community. But it is
wrong to accommodate a communist regime&rsquo;s goal and strategy
and deny the necessary and peaceful means for the 23
million people of Taiwan to defend their independent status
and freedom. This policy is wrong and it should not statnd.</p>
