<p>Mr. Lien&rsquo;s Political Judgment In Question
by James Wang</p>
<p>At a time when the Middle east was in crisis, the Bush
Administration was under fire for its inaction in seeking
for peace, and the situation in the Taiwan Strait was
relatively quiet, it is hard to explain why Mr. Lien Chan,
Chairman of the KMT, took a trip to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Mr. Lien&rsquo;s visit generated a brief report in the Washington
Times, which lead the story by quoting Mr. Lien as
predicting a Nationalists comeback. But I can hardly recall
any opposition leader failed to make such predictions. It is
not news and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to travel half the
distance of the globe to make such prediction.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that Mr. Lien&rsquo;s visit was hurriedly
arranged to pre-empt the previously scheduled visit of
former president Lee Teng-hui in late May, which had since
been cancelled. He wanted to address the National Press Club
ahead of Mr. Lee and spread messages that may serve to blunt
Mr. Lee&rsquo;s advocates for Taiwan&rsquo;s security and
participations in international communities.</p>
<p>But he was not well prepared and not effective. Absent from
Mr. Lien&rsquo;s messages were the achievements of democracy in
Taiwan, the constant threat to Taiwan&rsquo;s security by the
People&rsquo;s Republic of China, the need for Taiwan to
participate in international communities and the hiatus of
dialogue between Taiwan and PRC due to PRC&rsquo;s insistence on
Taiwan&rsquo;s acceptance of its pre-condition.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he talked about the woes of Taiwan&rsquo;s
economy since President Chen Sui-bian took office two years
ago. He blamed on Chen&rsquo;s administration for the deadlock
between Taiwan and PRC. He charged that the DPP government
has adopted Taiwan Independence policies and even accused
the government of purposely maintaining tension in the
Taiwan Strait in order to win support in elections.</p>
<p>Mr. Lien reiterated the so-called &ldquo;One China, yes, but not
yet&rdquo; formula that was promoted by KMT in the early 90&rsquo;s. Of
course, he gave a laundry list of KMT victories in local
elections since it debacles in the Presidential election in
the year 2000 and the parlimentary election in 2001 and
predicted a KMT comeback in the future.</p>
<p>Talking to a foreign audience in a foreign countries on such
sensitive topics, Mr. Lien violated one cardinal rule of
politics: there is one President at a time and you don&rsquo;t
critize him while you are overseas. Even worse, he seemed
singing from the same sheet of music with Beijing. A Chinese
reporter loved his &ldquo;One China&rdquo; message so much that he asked
if Mr. Lien is willing to visit China to promote &ldquo;One China&rdquo;
principle. For sure, he left out Mr. Lien&rsquo;s &ldquo;but&rdquo; clause.</p>
<p>Mr. Lien said that the &ldquo;One China, yes, but not yet&rdquo; formula
was a classical face-saving measure for PRC. But I don&rsquo;t
think it is a meaningless measure for PRC or a harmless
concession from Taiwan. It would give PRC a legal base to
claim its sovereignty over Taiwan. It is a fatal cost for
Taiwan. And Mr. Lien didn&rsquo;t even bother to state that any
change of Taiwan&rsquo;s status quo should follow its democratic
processes.</p>
<p>One message Mr. Lien volunteered and emphasized was that the
sentiment of Taiwanese versus mainlanders no longer exists.
It struck me as odd. I don&rsquo;t believe he is so out of touch
with the reality in Taiwan and ignorant of different voting
patterens and certain policy orientations. If no such
sentiment existed since the 1960&rsquo;s, as Mr, Lien said, then
why the KMT tickets in the Presidential elections since 1978
have always included on mainlander and one Taiwanese?</p>
<p>On the issue of so-called &ldquo;national reunification&rdquo;, it is
undeniable that the mainlanders are more inclined to favor
that goal while Taiwanese more inclined to oppose. Mr. Lien
may think it unfortunate, but is is natural in a democratic
society. Any politician who fails to face this reality is
not expected to do well in Taiwan&rsquo;s politics. That was why
KMT won in 1996 when Mr. Lee Teng-hui was on top of the
ticket and KMT lost badly in 2000 when Mr. Lien was the
presidential candidate.</p>
<p>An opposition leader should have a shrewd judgment on what,
when and where to attack the government and his opponents.
By choosing to attack President Chen on China policy and to
mock his mentor Mr. Lee&rsquo;s political influence as &ldquo;passe&rdquo; and
&ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; while he was in the United States, Mr. Lien
showed his plitical judgment has more room for improvement.</p>
